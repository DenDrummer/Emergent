# Emergent

This is project is built from the [blank project provided by Improbable](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity-blank-project).

## Discord

Might still be a bit premature, but I made a discord server for the project.  
Feel free to join anyways and we'll see where this goes!

## How to start playing

Every once in a while I'll open up a deployment for 6 hours.  
When I open such a deployment I'll provide a link to play here and and until when it should be live.
